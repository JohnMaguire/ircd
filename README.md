# ircd

[![Build Status](https://github.com/JohnMaguire/ircd/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JohnMaguire/ircd/actions)

This is an experimental Rust IRCd. It is far from complete. I am aiming to implement [RFC 1459](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459), [RFC 2812](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2812), as well as any feasible [IRCv3 specifications](https://ircv3.net/irc/) while learning Rust.

Once an initial implementation is complete, I hope to experiment with new methods of server linking that can reduce netsplits. This project is inspired by [RobustIRC](https://robustirc.net/).
